# AlderCodeChallenge

I refactored to include calling the profile picture fetching method in the cellForRowAt: function, and changed the keys
in the image dictionary to be the profile picture's URL to make it substantially unique to prevent same first names.

I ran into an issue that I can't seem to figure out where scrolling seems to make it panic a little bit. I have been
unsuccessful in my efforts to debug and would like some feedback. Thanks for your time, I've enjoyed this challenge!
